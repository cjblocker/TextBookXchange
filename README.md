# TextbookXchange

Description:
This app was created to help students find a more efficient way to sell or rent out their textbooks. Our app allows users to view a catalog of current book listings and search for a specific textbook before registering. After registering, users are allowed to list books for sale, request a textbook and edit their requests and listed textbooks. 

#Search:

The Search feature is available on the 'Home' page as well as the 'Catalog' page. It allows users to search for a textbook by the title of the book, the course number or the author. After searching, the user will be redirected to the Catalog page where any results will be displayed. 

#Catalog:

The catalog page allows anyone -- registered or not registered -- to view the list of available books and each book's corresponding information. Each item in the catalog has an arrow button to control how much of a textbook's information is available. The catalog page also has a search bar in place so that users can find what they're looking for more quickly. 

#Request:

The request page allows registered users to request a textbook by book title and course number. Once a request has been submitted by a user, that request will be posted to the user's dashboard. From the dashboard, the user will be able to see the status of his request (i.e. if the book has been posted or become available yet) If the book is not available in the catalog, the request will state that the item is not available. Requests are also removable from the dashboard.

#List a Book:

Registered users can list a textbook to TextbookXchange from the 'List Book' page. The accompanying form requires the user to submit the book title, course number for the textbook (example: CS360), textbook author, textbook edition, whether the book is for rent or for sale, an asking price, and any additional notes. All of this information as well as the seller's name and email address will be posted with the textbook in the catalog. Listed books can be viewed, updated and/or removed from the user's dashboard.

#Dashboard:

After logging in, a user's book requests and listed textbooks will show up in the 'Dashboard' page. Request statuses can be viewed here and will update instantly if the requested textbook is added. In addition, a user's listed textbooks can be removed or deleted here.

#Login / Registration:

Users can login or register for TextbookXchange. Registered users will have their information maintained by TextbookXchange, which includes all of their listed books and requests. Once they are finished with their session, they can logout and their private information will no longer be viewable. Registration requires a name, email address, username and password. Usernames are unique to a given person.
